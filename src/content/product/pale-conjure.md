Pale Conjure is a 1-3 session original adventure for d100 adventure games like Cthulhu Eternal, Call of Cthulhu and Delta Green.

In the beauty of autumn in upstate New York, a young professor's wife has mysteriously fallen ill. He suspects sorcery may be involved.

It's up to the investigators to discover the truth about what happened, all while avoiding being caught up in the tangle of his life.

Meant to evoke classic Weird Tales, Pale Conjure is inspired by the stories of Fritz Leiber, HP Lovecraft, and movies like The Witch and The Devil Rides Out.
