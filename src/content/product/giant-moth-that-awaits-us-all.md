Explore the far future, a world where:

- CAPITALISM has run rampant!
- ordering FOOD from restaurants is weirdly specific!
- plays can end with IMPROMPTU executions!
- WIZARDS can't be trusted
- birds can TALK!

The Giant Moth that Protects the World lies imprisoned under a mountain, and your party of adventurers has been enlisted to free her.

Aside from the main adventure (a Dungeon Crawl Classics adventure intended for player characters of level 1), THE GIANT MOTH THAT AWAITS US ALL also includes:

- An introduction to the City of 10,000 Pilgrims, where clerics of every stripe come together to fight in the streets over whose god is the greatest.
- Three things to do in the City
- A new class based on one type of said pilgrim
- A new spell, specifically for market-minded wizards
- Includes all new original interior art and maps by Gino Vasconcelos and a cover by Acid Lich.
